# Predictive Modeling and Analysis of Pima Indians Diabetes Using Regression Techniques in R:

# Introduction
The objective of this project was to develop a predictive model to identify individuals at risk of diabetes using clinical features such as glucose levels, blood pressure, and BMI. The project explores different machine learning techniques, including logistic regression and Lasso regression, to build and evaluate models.

# Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the Pima Indians Diabetes Database, which contains 768 observations and 8 clinical features. The target variable is a binary outcome indicating the presence or absence of diabetes.
